Here we will describe the Github projects under the
[PTAnywhere organization](https://github.com/PTAnywhere), how to use them and
how to contribute to them.

_PTAnywhere_ is composed by...

*   [Scripts which ease the installation and deployment of all its components](https://github.com/PTAnywhere/ptAnywhere-installation)
*   [An HTTP API for Packet Tracer](https://github.com/PTAnywhere/ptAnywhere-api)
*   [A JavaScript client for the API](https://github.com/PTAnywhere/ptAnywhere-js)
*   [An internal HTTP API for creating different instances of Packet Tracer](https://github.com/PTAnywhere/pt-instances-management)
*   [An application with a set of widgets to interact with Packet Tracer through the web](https://github.com/PTAnywhere/ptAnywhere-widgets)
*   [A JavaScript library to ease the creation of widgets](https://github.com/PTAnywhere/widget-ui)

Additionally, we have also made public the following related projects:

*   [performance-testing](http://ptanywhere.github.io/performance-testing/) is
    a Python project created to measure the performance of PTAnywhere
    (specifically the Docker-based _Packet Tracer_ container).

*   [usage-analysis](https://github.com/PTAnywhere/usage-analysis) is a web
    application which visualizes users interactions with the widgets in
    different ways.

*   [PTChecker](https://github.com/PTAnywhere/pt-checker) hosts both a Python
    and a Java library to check if a _Packet Tracer_ instance is running on a
    given host and port.
