=====================

Documentation to develop or administer _PT Anywhere_.

This site uses [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) so just install it...
``` 
gem install bundle
bundle install
```

...and build it!
```
 # In my case it didn't work the first time so I executed "bundle update"
jekyll serve
```
